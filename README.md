The Odin Project's "Project: Google Homepage" Lesson.

This project is an introductory assignment after a briefing overview of CSS and HTML in The Odin Project's Foundation course for HTML and CSS.

The task is to create a replica of the design of the Google homepage using what we have learned about HTML, CSS, and the Chrome Inspector.

During this project, I have learned and implemented many skills for the first time such as:

1. Skills with the Chrome Inspector
    -learning how to pinpoint design elements and understanding each elements' style
    -implementing style code from another website
2. Familiarity with HTML and design concepts
    -implementing HTML and understanding the importance of overall structure and conventions
3. Implementation of CSS and many design elements such as Flexbox and Layout
    -understanding how nested elements inherit styles from parents
    -understanding how different Layout properties affect the position of an element
    -understanding the function and nuances of certain CSS properties such as margin, position
    -implementing animation effects with hover property and shadow/opacity  properties
